        <h1>Solo - Frank Ocean</h1>

        <p>
            <p>
        Hand me a towel, I'm dirty dancing by myself<br>
	Gone off tabs of that acid<br>
	Form me a circle, watch my Jagger<br>
	Might lose my jacket and hit a solo<br>
	One time<br>
	We too loud in public then police turned down the function<br>
	Now we outside and the timing's perfect<br>
	Forgot to tell you, gotta tell you how much I vibe with you<br>
	And we don't gotta be solo<br>
		<br>
		<br>
	Now stay away from highways<br>
	My eyes like them red lights<br>
	Right now I prefer yellow<br>
	Redbone, so mellow<br>
	Fuck 'round, be cutting you<br>
	Think we were better off solo<br>
	I got that act right in the Windy city that night<br>
	No trees to blow through<br>
	But blow me and I owe you<br<br>
	Two grams when the sun rise<br>
	Smoking good, rolling solo<br>
		<br>
		<br>
	Solo (solo)<br>
	Solo (solo)<br>
	S-solo (solo)<br>
	S-solo (solo)<br>
		<br>
		<br>
	It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire<br>
	Inhale, in hell there's heaven<br>
	There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky<br>
	Inhale, in hell there's heaven<br>
	Oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
	Oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
	Solo, solo<br>
	Solo, solo<br>
		<br>
		<br>
	I'm skipping showers and switching socks, sleeping good and long<br>
	Bones feeling dense as fuck, wish a nigga would cross<br>
	And catch a solo, on time<br>
	White leaf on my boxers, green leaf turn to vapors for the low<br>
	And that mean cheap, cause ain't shit free and I know it<br>
	Even love ain't, 'cause this nut cost, that clinic killed my soul<br>
	But you gotta hit the pussy raw though<br>
	Now your baby momma ain't so vicious, all she want is her picket fence<br>
	And you protest and you picket sign, but them courts won't side with you<br>
	Won't let you fly solo<br>
	I wanted that act right in Colorado that night<br>
	I brought trees to blow through, but it's just me and no you<br>
	Stayed up 'til my phone died<br>
	Smoking big, rolling solo<br>
		<br>
		<br>
	It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire<br>
	Inhale, in hell there's heaven<br>
	There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky<br>
	Inhale, in hell there's heaven<br>
	Oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
	Oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
	Ah (solo, solo)<br>
	(Solo)<br>
	By myself<br>
	(Solo)<br>
	(Solo, solo)<br>
	(Solo, solo)<br>
        	<br>
		<br>
	</p>
